Function; Description
`length(x)`; returns the length of vector x (i.e. the number of elements in `x`)
`names(x)`; get or set names of x (i.e. we can give names to the individual elements of `x` as well as just having them numbered)
`min(x)`; returns the smallest value in `x`
`max(x)`; returns the largest value in `x`
`median(x)`; returns the median of `x`
`range(x)`; returns a vector with the smallest and largest values in `x`
`sum(x)`; returns the sum of values in `x`
`mean(x)`; returns the mean of values in `x`
`sd(x)`; returns the standard deviation of `x`
`var(x)`; returns the variance of `x`
`diff(x)`; returns a vector with all of the differences between subsequent values of `x`. This vector is of length 1 less than the length of `x`
`summary(x)`; returns different types of summary output depending on the type of variable stored in `x`
